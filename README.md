使用Resnet50做图片分类
# input
model:https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/resnet-v2/TensorFlow2/101-classification/2
The checkpoint exported into this model was resnet_v2_101_2017_04_14/resnet_v2_101.ckpt downloaded from TF-Slim's pre-trained models. Its weights were originally obtained by training on the ILSVRC-2012-CLS dataset for image classification ("Imagenet").
